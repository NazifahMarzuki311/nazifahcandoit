					<div class="intro" style="font-family: arial;font-size: 16px;">
						<p>First of all, I would like to say Alhamdullillah and be grateful for being given the opportunity to complete an individual project that is to create a personal website. I would like to thank Sir Faizal Haini Bin Fadzil who has taught me a lot in this subject which is IMD 311, so that I managed to create my personal website successfully. Without him I might have had a hard time completing this individual project. In addition, thank you to my classmates who have given me a lot of support and assistance to complete this individual project. Not to forget my family members who gave a lot of support and words of encouragement and were always by my side when I faced difficult days.</p>

						<p>My full name is Nur Fatin Nazifah Binti Marzuki from class D1IM1105A and my studentâ€™s matriculation number is 2020739447. I am a Diploma in Information Management student, and I started this blog to keep this page as an individual assignment of IMD311 subject. I am currently a full -time student at UiTM Kelantan, Machang Campus. I am a person who loves to read stories book especially about fantasy worlds like Harry Potter. I am very interested in the novel. I dream of being a great writer like J.K. Rowling. Sometimes when I have free time I will read a storybook or novel about a story that interests me. Sometimes I try to write my own story where I get ideas from the results of my reading. I love writing about family stories, romance and action.</p>

						<p>Speaking of myself, my interest in reading makes me more interested in being a writer especially writing about life stories. I really hope this page can grow into a space where all the stories I have produced can be shared here. Apart from reading, I also like to spend time watching movies and dramas. I also love listening to songs while doing daily chores. Finally, please enjoy my personal web page!</p>
